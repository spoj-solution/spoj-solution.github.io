### **Statement**

Background

In 1949 the Indian mathematician D.R. Kaprekar discovered a class of numbers
called _self-numbers_. For any positive integer _n_ , define _d(n)_ to be _n_
plus the sum of the digits of _n_. (The _d_ stands for _digitadition_ , a term
coined by Kaprekar.) For example:

d(75) = 75 + 7 + 5 = 87

Given any positive integer n as a starting point, you can construct the
infinite increasing sequence of integers _n, d(n), d(d(n)), d(d(d(n))), ..._
For example, if you start with 33, the next number is 33 + 3 + 3 = 39, the
next is 39 + 3 + 9 = 51, the next is 51 + 5 + 1 = 57, and so you generate the
sequence

33, 39, 51, 57, 69, 84, 96, 111, 114, 120, 123, 129, 141, ...

The number _n_ is called a _generator_ of _d(n)_. In the sequence above, 33 is
a generator of 39, 39 is a generator of 51, 51 is a generator of 57, and so
on.

Some numbers have more than one generator: For example, 101 has two
generators, 91 and 100. A number with no generators is a _self-number_. There
are thirteen self-numbers less than 100: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 20, 31, 42, 53, 64,
75, 86, and 97.

Problem

Write a program to output all positive self-numbers less than 1000000 in
increasing order, one per line.

Input

There is no input.

Output

All positive self-numbers less than 1000000 in increasing order, one per line.
