### **Statement**

We will call a bracket word any word constructed out of two sorts of
characters: the opening bracket "(" and the closing bracket ")". Among these
words we will distinguish correct bracket expressions. These are such
bracket words in which the brackets can be matched into pairs such that

  * every pair consists of an opening bracket and a closing bracket appearing further in the bracket word
  * for every pair the part of the word between the brackets of this pair has equal number of opening and closing brackets 

On a bracket word one can do the following operations:

  *replacement \-- changes the i-th bracket into the opposite one
  *check \-- if the word is a correct bracket expression

### Task

Write a program which

  * reads (from standard input) the bracket word and the sequence of operations performed, 
  * for every check operation determines if the current bracket word is a correct bracket expression, 
  * writes out the outcome (to standard output). 

### Input

Ten test cases (given one under another, you have to process all!). Each of
the test cases is a series of lines. The first line of a test consists of a
single number _n (1 <=n<=30000)_ denoting the length of the bracket word. The
second line consists of _n_ brackets, not separated by any spaces. The third
line consists of a single number _m_ \-- the number of operations. Each of the
following _m_ lines carries a number _k_ denoting the operation performed.
_k=0_ denotes the check operation, _k >0_ denotes replacement of _k_ -th
bracket by the opposite.

### Output

For every test case your program should print a line:  
Test i:  
where i is replaced by the number of the test and in the following lines, for
every check operation in the i-th test your program should print a line with
the word YES, if the current bracket word is a correct bracket expression, and
a line with a word NO otherwise. (There should be as many lines as check
operations in the test.)
