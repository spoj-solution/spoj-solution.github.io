### **Statement**

Your program is to use the brute-force approach in order to _find the Answer
to Life, the Universe, and Everything._ More precisely... rewrite small
numbers from input to output. Stop processing input after reading in the
number 42. All numbers at input are integers of one or two digits.  
  

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    1
    2
    88
    42
    99
    
    Output:
    1
    2
    88
