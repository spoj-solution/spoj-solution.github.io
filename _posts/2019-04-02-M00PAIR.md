### **Statement**

[English](/problems/M00PAIR/en/) | [Vietnamese](/problems/M00PAIR/vn/)  
---|---  
  
A sequence consisting of one digit, the number 1 is initially written into a
computer. At each successive time step, the computer simultaneously tranforms
each digit 0 into the sequence 1 0 and each digit 1 into the sequence 0 1.

So, after the first time step, the sequence 0 1 is obtained; after the second,
the sequence 1 0 0 1, after the third, the sequence 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 and so on.

How many pairs of consequitive zeroes will appear in the sequence after n
steps?

### Input

Clarification for this Problem: The Range of inputs is from 1 to 999 in some
order and in particular not in ascending order

### Output

For each input n print the number of consequitive zeroes pairs that will
appear in the sequence after n steps.

### Sample

    
    
    Sample Input   
    1  
    2   
    3   
    4  
    5   
    Sample output   
    0  
    1   
    1  
    3  
    5  
     

Notice : Long output - 1.45MB \- there are a lot of input/output so it is
easy to TLE if you dont optimize in/out if you use Java ...
