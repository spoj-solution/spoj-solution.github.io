### **Statement**

![Crowd in the supermarket](/content/ahven:shopping.jpg)The old tube screen to
your computer turned out to be the cause of your chronic headaches. You
therefore decide to buy one of these new flat TFT monitors. At the entrance of
the computer shop you see that it is quite full with customers.

In fact, the shop is rather packed with customers and moving inside involves a
certain amount of elbowing. Since you want to return home quickly to complete
your half finished SPOJ tasks, you want to sidestep the crowd as much as
possible. You examine the situation somewhat closer and realise that the
crowding is less in some parts of the shop. Thus, there is reason for hope
that you can reach your goal in due time, provided that you take the shortest
way. But which way is the shortest way?

You sketch the situation on a piece of paper but even so, it is still a tricky
affair. You take out your notebook from your pocket and start to write a
program which will find the shortest way for you.

### Input

The first line of the input specifies the width w and height h of the shop.
Neither dimension exceeds 25.

The following h lines contain w characters each. A letter X symbolises a
shelf, the letter S marks your starting position, and the letter D marks the
destination (i.e. the square in front of the monitors). All free squares are
marked with a digit from 1 to 9, meaning the number of seconds needed to pass
this square.

There are many test cases separated by an empty line. Input terminates with
width and height equal 0 0.

### Output

Your program is to output the minimum number of seconds needed to reach to
destination square. Each test case in a separate line. Movements can only be
vertical and horizontal. Of course, all movements must take place inside the
grid. There will always be a way to reach the destination.
