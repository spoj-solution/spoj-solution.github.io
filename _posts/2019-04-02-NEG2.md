categories: ['uncategorized']
code: NEG2

### **Statement**

Inexperienced in the digital arts, the cows tried to build a calculating
engine (yes, it's a cowmpouter) using binary numbers (base 2) but instead
built one based on base negative 2! They were quite pleased since numbers
expressed in base -2 do not have a sign bit.

You know number bases have place values that start at 1 (base to the 0 power)
and proceed right-to-left to base^1, base^2, and so on. In base -2, the place
values are 1, -2, 4, -8, 16, -32, ... (reading from right to left). Thus,
counting from 1 goes like this: 1, 110, 111, 100, 101, 11010, 11011, 11000,
11001, and so on.

Eerily, negative numbers are also represented with 1's and 0's but no sign.
Consider counting from -1 downward: 11, 10, 1101, 1100, 1111, and so on.

Please help the cows convert ordinary decimal integers (range -2,000,000,000
.. 2,000,000,000) to their counterpart representation in base -2.

### Input

A single integer to be converted to base -2

### Output

A single integer with no leading zeroes that is the input integer converted to
base -2. The value 0 is expressed as 0, with exactly one 0.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    -13
    
    Output:
    110111
