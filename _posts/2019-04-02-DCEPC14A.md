### **Statement**

DCE Coders admins are way much geekier than they actually seem! Kartik has
been following that tradition lately. How? Well, he took the inversion count
problem to a whole new level!

Sounds pretty normal to you, huh? Wanna challenge him? Try solving his version
of inversion count then!

You are given a 2-d array of integers. You need to find out the inversion
count of that array. A pair of integers in the 2-d array counts as an
inversion pair (A,B) if and only if:

  * There exists a valid path from top-left corner (0,0) to bottom right corner (r,c) such that A and B integers lie on that path.
  * A occurs before B on that path.
  * And, A > B.

A valid path is defined as a path that can be traversed from top-left corner
(0,0) to bottom-right corner (r,c) by moving only in right or downwards
direction, without moving out of the grid.

Are you geekier than Kartik?

Constraints:

0 < R,C <= 300

0 < Ai <= 10^5, where Ai stands for an integer in the array.

### Input

First line contains space separated 2 integers, R and C, denoting the number
of rows and columns.

Next R lines contain C space separated integers representing the 2-d array

### Output

Output the number of inversion pairs as described in the problem statement.
