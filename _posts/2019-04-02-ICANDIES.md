### **Statement**

Sava is a student of class X. She has two little sisters Sara and Sami. Sara
is only 3 years old and Sami is a girl of 5 years. At her birthday Sava bought
N candies and wants to divide them between her two sisters Sara and Sami. But
as Sara is 3 years old she wants such amount of candies that is perfectly
divisible by 3. Sami also wants the amount of her candies to be perfectly
divisible by 5 and only this way both of them are happy otherwise they become
unhappy.

So, Sava wants to make both of them happy. Now for some value of N Sava can
divide the candies in various ratio that will make her sisters happy. But as
Sara is the youngest one she wants to give the maximum number of candies she
can. As Sava is not good enough in math, she wants your help.

### Input

Input starts with an integer T (1≤T≤50), denoting the number of test cases.
Each of the test cases consists an integer N (1≤N≤10<sup>6</sup>), the
number of candies Sava bought.

### Output

For each case print "Case X: " where X (1≤X≤T) is the case number. And then,
if it is possible to divide the candies making both of them happy print the
maximum number of candies you can give to Sara. And if it is not possible to
make both of them happy then print '-1' (without the quotes).

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
     3
    
    8
    
    9
    
    20
    
    Output:
    
    
     Case 1: 3
    
    Case 2: -1
    
    Case 3: 15
