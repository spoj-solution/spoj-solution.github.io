### **Statement**

Anjali and Nakul are good friends. They both had a quarrel recently while
playing chess. Nakul wants to know the minimum number of moves a knight takes
to reach from one square to another square of a chess board (8X8). Nakul is
brilliant and he had already written a program to solve the problem. Nakul
wants to know whether Anjali can do it. Anjali is very weak in programming.
Help her to solve the problem.

A knight can move in the shape of an "L" in a chessboard - two squares either
forward, backward, left, or right and then one square to its left or right. A
knight move is valid if it moves as mentioned above and it is within the
boundary of the chessboard (8 X 8).

### Input

There are T test cases in total. The next T lines contain two strings (start
and destination) separated by a space.

The strings start and destination will only contain two characters - First
character is an alphabet between 'a' and 'h' (inclusive), Second character is
a digit between '1' and '8' (inclusive) - (Quotes just for clarity).

To know the knight moves more clearly refer to the above figure.

### Output

Print the minimum number of moves a knight takes to reach from start to
destination in a separate line.

### Constarints

1 <= T <= 4096

### Example
