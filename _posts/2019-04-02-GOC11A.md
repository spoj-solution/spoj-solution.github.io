### **Statement**

You are given a string S, you need to build another string T by expanding S
according to the steps below (traversing left to right):

  1. If current character is an alphabet, append it to T. 

  2. If current character is a digit, suppose the digit is N, then do T = N*T. Here N*T means appending T N times. See sample for better understanding.

  3. Go to next character if exists then restart from step 1.

Upon expanding S, you will be given Q queries. For each query you have to
print the i<sub>th</sub> character of the string T.

Hint : After expanding the string S=”a3b2c1” T will be = “aaabaaabc”

### Input

The first line will be the test case number(t<=10).

In the first line of each test you will be given a string consisting of
lowercase letters and digits. And it is guaranteed that length of T will be no
more than 1000.

Next line will contain an integer Q(<=100000) denoting total numbers of
queries. Following Q lines each contains an integer X.

Output

For each query X, you have to print the X<sub>th</sub> character of T in a
line. If X is greater than the length of T, print -1.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    
    
     1
    
    a3b2c1
    
    2
    
    4
    
    5
    
     Output:
    
    
     b
    
    a
