### **Statement**

You are given a sequence A[1], A[2], ..., A[N] . ( |A[i]| ≤ 15007 , 1 ≤ N ≤
50000 ). A query is defined as follows:  
Query(x,y) = Max { a[i]+a[i+1]+...+a[j] ; x ≤ i ≤ j ≤ y }.  
Given M queries, your program must output the results of these queries.

### Input

  * The first line of the input file contains the integer N.
  * In the second line, N numbers follow.
  * The third line contains the integer M.
  * M lines follow, where line i contains 2 numbers xi and yi.

### Output

Your program should output the results of the M queries, one query per line.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3 
    -1 2 3
    1
    1 2
    
    Output:
