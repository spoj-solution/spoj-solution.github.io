### **Statement**

Given a string, count the number of distinct subsequences of it ( including
empty subsequence ). For the uninformed, A subsequence of a string is a new
string which is formed from the original string by deleting some of the
characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining
characters.  
For example, "AGH" is a subsequence of "ABCDEFGH" while "AHG" is not.

### Input

First line of input contains an integer T which is equal to the number of test
cases. You are required to process all test cases. Each of next T lines
contains a string s.

### Output

Output consists of T lines. Ith line in the output corresponds to the number
of distinct subsequences of ith input string. Since, this number could be very
large, you need to output ans%1000000007 where ans is the number of distinct
subsequences.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    3
    AAA
    ABCDEFG
    CODECRAFT
    
    
    Output:
    4
    128
    496
    

### Constraints and Limits

T ≤ 100, length(S) ≤ 100000  
All input strings shall contain only uppercase letters.
