### **Statement**

Let us see the following equation,

_ax+by=c_

Given three positive integers a , b and c. You have to determine
whether there exists at least one solution for some integers value of x
and y where x , y may be negative or non-negative integers.

For example if a=2 , b=4 and c=8 then the equation will be
2x+4y=8 , and hence, for x=2 and y=1 , there exists a solution.

Let us see another example for a=3 , b=6 and c=7 , so the equation
will become 3x+6y=7 and there exists no solution satisfying this equation.

Input

Input starts with an integer T (1 <=T<=10<sup>5</sup>) denoting the
number of test cases. Each test case contains three integers a , b ,
and c. (1 <=a, b, c<=10<sup>6</sup>).

Output

For each test case of input print the case number and “ Yes ” if there
exists at least one solution, print “ No ” otherwise.
