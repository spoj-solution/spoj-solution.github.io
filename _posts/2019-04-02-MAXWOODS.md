### **Statement**

Problem Statement:

![](../../../content/cegprakash:maxwoods.png)

  


The image explains it all. You initially step at 0,0 facing right. At each
step you can move according to the conditions specified in the image. You
cannot step into the blocked boxes (in blue). Find the maximum number of trees
you can cut.

Input:

The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each
test case the first line consists of two integers m and n, the number of rows
and columns. Then follows the description of the matrix M.

M[i][j]=’T’ if the region has a tree.

M[i][j]=’#’ if the region is blocked.

M[i][j]=’0’ (zero) otherwise.

Output:

For each test case find the maximum trees that you can cut.

Input Constraints:

1<=t<=10

1<=m,n<=200
