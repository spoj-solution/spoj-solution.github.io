### **Statement**

“ _It’s Black, It’s White, It’s Tough For You To Get By_ ”  
Michael Jackson (1958-2009)

  
You have a sequence of integers. You can paint each of the integers black or
white, or leave  
it unpainted. The black integers must appear in ascending order and the white
integers  
must appear in descending order. The ascending/descending order must be
strict, that  
is, two integers painted with the same color cannot be equal. Paint the
sequence so as to  
minimize the number of unpainted integers.

### Input

The input contains several test cases, each one described in exactly two
lines. The first line  
contains an integer N indicating the number of elements in the sequence (1 ≤ N
≤ 200).  
The second line contains N integers Xi separated by single spaces,
representing the  
sequence to paint (1 ≤ Xi ≤ 10<sup>6</sup> for 1 ≤ i ≤ N ). The last line
of the input contains a  
single −1 and should not be processed as a test case.

### Output

For each test case output a single line with an integer representing the
minimum number  
of unpainted elements of the sequence, when the sequence is painted optimally
following  
the rules described above.

### Example

    
    
    Input:  
     8  
    1 4 2 3 3 2 4 1  
    12  
    7 8 1 2 4 6 3 5 2 1 8 7  
    -1  
      
     Output:
    0  
     2
