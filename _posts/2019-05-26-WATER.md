title:  WATER - Water among Cubes
categories: ['bfs']
code: WATER
src: WATER.cpp
---

### **Statement**

On a rectangular mesh comprising _n*m_ fields, _n*m_ cuboids were put, one
cuboid on each field. A base of each cuboid covers one field and its surface
equals to one square inch. Cuboids on adjacent fields adhere one to another so
close that there are no gaps between them. A heavy rain pelted on a
construction so that in some areas puddles of water appeared.

### Task

Write a program which:

  * reads from the standard input a size of the chessboard and heights of cuboids put on the fields, 
  * computes maximal water volume, which may gather in puddles after the rain, 
  * writes results in the standard output. 

### Input

The number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases
follow separated by an empty line. In the first line of each test case two
positive integers 1 <= _n_ <= 100, 1 <= _m_ <= 100 are written. They are the
size of the mesh. In each of the following _n_ lines there are _m_ integers
from the interval [1..10000]; _i_ -th number in _j_ -th line denotes a height
of a cuboid given in inches put on the field in the _i_ -th column and _j_ -th
raw of the chessboard.

### Output

Your program should write for each tes case one integer equal to the maximal
volume of water (given in cubic inches), which may gather in puddles on the
construction.

### Example

    
    
    Sample input:
    1
    3 6
    3 3 4 4 4 2
    3 1 3 2 1 4
    7 3 1 6 4 1
    
    Sample output:
    5

drawn in gray.
