### **Statement**

It is said that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more whole
integers, is the largest integer that divides them without leaving residue.
Euclid's algorithm is famous for allowing to find the GCD between two
integers. This challenge asks you, you find the GCD between three integers.

Challenge

The entry consists of 3 whole nonnegative integers (< 2<sup>64</sup>), one
per line and the output will be the GCD of the 3 integers.
