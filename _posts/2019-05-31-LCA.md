### **Statement**

A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by
exactly one simple path. In other words, any connected graph without cycles is
a tree. - Wikipedia

The lowest common ancestor (LCA) is a concept in graph theory and computer
science. Let T be a rooted tree with N nodes. The lowest common ancestor is
defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and
w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself). -
Wikipedia

Your task in this problem is to find the LCA of any two given nodes v and w in
a given tree T.

### ![](http://spoj.com/content/piotrkakol:lca.gif)

For example the LCA of nodes 9 and 12 in this tree is the node number 3.

### Input

The first line of input will be the number of test cases. Each test case will
start with a number N the number of nodes in the tree, 1 <= N <= 1,000. Nodes
are numbered from 1 to N. The next N lines each one will start with a number M
the number of child nodes of the Nth node, 0 <= M <= 999 followed by M numbers
the child nodes of the Nth node. The next line will be a number Q the number
of queries you have to answer for the given tree T, 1 <= Q <= 1000. The next Q
lines each one will have two number v and w in which you have to find the LCA
of v and w in T, 1 <= v, w <= 1,000.

Input will guarantee that there is only one root and no cycles.

### Output

For each test case print Q + 1 lines, The first line will have “Case C:”
without quotes where C is the case number starting with 1. The next Q lines
should be the LCA of the given v and w respectively.
