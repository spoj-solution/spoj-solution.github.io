### **Statement**

You are given a tree (an undirected acyclic connected graph) with N nodes,
and edges numbered 1, 2, 3... N -1. Each edge has an integer value
assigned to it, representing its length.

We will ask you to perfrom some instructions of the following form:

  *DIST a b : ask for the distance between node a and node b  
or

  *KTH a b k : ask for the k -th node on the path from node a to node b

Example:  
N = 6  
1 2 1 // edge connects node 1 and node 2 has cost 1  
2 4 1  
2 5 2  
1 3 1  
3 6 2  
  
Path from node 4 to node 6 is 4 - > 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6  
DIST 4 6 : answer is 5 (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5)  
KTH 4 6 4 : answer is 3 (the 4-th node on the path from node 4 to node 6
is 3)  

### Input

The first line of input contains an integer t , the number of test cases (
t <= 25). t test cases follow.

For each test case:

  * In the first line there is an integer N ( N <= 10000) 
  * In the next N -1 lines, the i-th line describes the i-th edge: a line with three integers a b c denotes an edge between a , b of cost c ( c <= 100000) 
  * The next lines contain instructions "DIST a b" or "KTH a b k"
  * The end of each test case is signified by the string " DONE ". 

There is one blank line between successive tests.

### Output

For each "DIST" or "KTH" operation, write one integer representing its
result.

Print one blank line after each test.
