### **Statement**

Given an array a of N integers a1, a2, a3, ... aN you have to find the longest
alternating sub-sequence of this array .  
An alternating sequence b1, b2 ... bk, k>=1 is a sequence that has the 2
following properties:  
1.|b1| 2\. The signs alternate between adjacent elements, i.e, if b1 > 0 then
b2<0, b3 >0 and so on. Alternatively, if b1<0, then b2>0, b3<0 and so on.  
A sub sequence of array a is a sequence obtained by dropping some elements of
the array a. Here is the formal definition.  
It is guaranteed that the array a contains no element equal to 0.

### Constraints

1<=N<=5000 |ai|<=10^9, ai not equal to 0.

### Input

The first line contains a single integer N, denoting the size of the array.
The next line contains N integers , denoting the array a.

### Output

Print a single integer - the length of the longest alternating sub-sequence.

### Example

    
    
    Input:
    8
    1 2 -2 -3 5 -7 -8 10
    
    Output:
    5
    

### Explaination

###  One of the longest alternating subsequence is 1 -2 5 -7 10
